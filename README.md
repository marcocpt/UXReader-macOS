### UXReader PDF Framework for macOS

The UXReader PDF Framework for macOS is a fully open-source macOS PDF Framework based
on the open-source [PDFium](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/) library.

The code is written in Objective-C++ (works with Swift or plain Objective-C) and does
not require storyboards or NIBs (all UI elements are generated in code with graphics
resources bundled in the framework).

After cloning or downloading the sources, you will need to download the [PDFium](https://github.com/vfr/UXReader-macOS/releases)
lib*.a file ZIP and extract it over the UXReader/UXReader/PDFium directory before building in Xcode.
